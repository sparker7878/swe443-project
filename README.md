SYTech is a technology company developing an application in the food industry. The application seeks to aid busy college students at GMU in determining where they should eat. There are numerous factors that must be taken into consideration to produce quality results. We have organized these into three major areas of functionality.

Restaurant Reviews
Users will be able to view reviews of restaurants in the area and leave reviews as well. These reviews will be used for future suggestions.

Personal Profile
This will include account information with the ability to make changes as necessary. It will also allow users to personalize their account by selecting their favorite restaurants and food dislikes. 

Restaurant Generator
This will allow the user to place filters such as category, distance, and price. It will then generate a suggested restaurant, taking their personalized information into consideration.
